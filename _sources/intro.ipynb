    "# Introduction to the practicals\n",
    "\n",
    "These practicals introduce a core set of GIS concepts and functions in R and then explore some more common use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these practicals are **self-paced**: you can work through them at your own speed and call out when you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three before 'me'\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a team of demonstrators to help you when you get stuck but please do remember that helping yourself is actually a far better way to learn. We do _not_ want you to struggle but before you reach out to a demonstrator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask *yourself* what you are trying to do: often stepping back and trying to write out an explanation for your problem helps you solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ask the *internet*: Sites like [stackoverflow.com]() are an invaluable resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ask *each other*: it can be really helpful to get together in a short Team meeting and crowd source an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of those work then ask us!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each practical has its own RStudio Cloud Project. This will contain all of the data needed for the practical and will have the required packages pre-installed.\n",
    "* If you are working on your own computer, you will need to download the data files and set up a working directory with a `data` folder.\n",
    "* Once you have your working directory set up and are running in R then do create a new script file to put your code in.\n",
    "* Work through the handouts at your own pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Introducing tasks\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of these practicals will consist of following provided code to understand how it works but occasionally there will be **tasks** to test the skills you have been learning. These will start with a task bar like the one above and then have a description like this one. There will then always be a button marked 'Click to show': if you get really stuck, you can click on this to show a solution. Do try and figure it out for yourself and if you don't understand something, ask a demonstrator to help.\n",
